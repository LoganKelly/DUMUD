Subject Vampiric Haste, Race field on skills~
Text
Added the vampiric haste skill for vampire warriors, and also added an
extra field onto all skills in the game, the race field.  The race field
determines which races are able to use a particular skill, so now we are
able to make certain skills only usable by particular race/class
combinations.  New characters who are NOT both a vampire and a warrior
should not be able to gain the new vampiric haste skill when they customize,
(hopefully).
